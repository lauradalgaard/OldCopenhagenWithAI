# OldCopenhagenWithAI
This repository contains data for the study Old Copenhagen with AI, which explores how AI-generated videos impact nostalgia and collective memory. Through a survey experiment using AI-restored and original 1920s Copenhagen footage, we examine if AI evokes the same nostalgia as historical videos.hese videos shape perceptions of Copenhagen's past.
