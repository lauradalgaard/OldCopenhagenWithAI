# OldCopenhagenWithAI
This repository contains data, code, and analysis for the study "Old Copenhagen with AI", which investigates how AI-restored videos impact nostalgia and the reconstruction of collective memory. The study uses videos from the Instagram account @kend_din_by as a case, which restores historical footage of Copenhagen using AI technologies.

Through a quantitative survey experiment, participants were randomly divided into two comparison groups and shown either an AI-restored colorized video or the original black-and-white footage of 1910's and 20s Copenhagen. The aim was to determine if AI-generated reconstructions evoke the same sense of nostalgia as original historical footage and how these videos shape perceptions of Copenhagen's past.

Our research questions for the report was:
How does the Instagram account @kend_din_by use AI to reconstruct collective memory of Copenhagen?
Do AI-reconstructed videos evoke the same feelings of nostalgia as original historical videos?

<b>Contents:</b>
* Data Files: Raw survey data, cleaned SPSS datasets and outputs with tests used in the report.
